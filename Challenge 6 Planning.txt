Challenge 6:

Keep in Mind:
keep track of number of VALID guesses
no minuses


player guess between 0 - 100
invalid if: outside 0 - 100, not a digit

states check diff (diff):
add all numbers into array (50, 35, 25...)
while loop - while (bool complete == false)
int i = 0;
if diff > arr[i]
return states[i]
else if arr[i + 1] <= d && d < arr[i]
i++;
return states[i]
complete = true;
else if diff == 0
return states = completed

int Check Valid:
bool valid
while (valid == false)
prompt for guess
if (!(cin [identifier]))
error text
else if (not in range)
error text
else: valid = true;
return guess;

void SwitchState (states state)
switch (state)
print out messages

gameloop (bool& win)
int guess = checkvalid()
[gen rand num]
diff = abs(guess - rand)
states currentstate = checkdiff(diff)
switchstate (currentstate)

if current state == completed
win = true

order of op:

while won == false
gameloop(won)
}

[win text]
