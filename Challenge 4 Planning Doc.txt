Repeatedly prompts user for text - while loop
Spaces shld be supported
Detect invalid input such as empty string, and numbers
	use cerr to make error message
	Should be prompted to re-enter text
User input should be repeated continuously


Tabulate each character with a '|', could use a for range loop
	2 spaces either side of char

Generate lines above and below the text alternating between '-' and '=', must be same length of the text, need to get num of chars in string { [identifier].length() }
	Use a '+' on places where it would line up with a '|'
		That means one '+' every 6 spaces

------------------------------------------------------------------------

pre-req:
	Input is saved in a string
		needs #include 'string'
	num of chars saved as an int
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create validation function
	should return a bool
	should take string as parameter
		if statement, use .empty() as condition
			True: return false
			False: return true


2. While loop 
	Condition could be while the input != "exit"
		If yes: exit program
		If no: continue

3. If statement
	Check that input is valid
		use the valid function as a condition
			False: produce error, reference function again to restart thus prompting them for text again
			True: continue

4. Make function to create lines, should take num of chars as input 
	for loop (int i = 0; i <= num of chars; i++)
		This loop should print "+=-=-="
		When finished print "+\n"


5. for loop going through all chars in a string { for(char& c : [input identifier]) }
	Should print "|  " << c << "  "

6. Call line function again

7. Call main();
